## Overview

The Search Country App is a web application built with React that enables users to search for countries and view detailed information such as capital, population, region, and flag. The app fetches real-time data from a public REST API and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Country Search**: Instantly search for any country by name.
- **Detailed Information**: View country details including flag, capital, region, population, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Fetches up-to-date country data from the REST Countries API.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and empty search results.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI and managing state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic and API integration.
- **CSS Modules / Styled-Components**: For modular and maintainable styling.
- **REST Countries API**: For real-time country data.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating with an external API and managing asynchronous data fetching was a key challenge. Implementing efficient search and handling edge cases (such as no results or API errors) provided valuable experience in React state management and user experience design.

## Outcome

The Search Country App demonstrates strong frontend skills in React, API integration, and responsive UI development. It serves as a practical example of building real-world, data-driven applications and can be extended with features like filtering by region or displaying maps in the future.
