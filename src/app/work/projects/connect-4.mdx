## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game, built using React. The game allows two players to take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid, with the goal of connecting four of their own discs in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two-player mode with real-time updates and visual feedback.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for a win or draw after each move.
- **Responsive UI**: The game board adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience.
- **Restart Option**: Players can reset the game at any time to play again.
- **Clean and Simple Design**: Focused on usability and clarity.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI and managing game state.
- **CSS Modules / Styled-Components**: For modular and maintainable styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core game logic and state management.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing efficient win detection logic for all possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) was a key challenge. Managing the game state and ensuring a smooth user experience across devices also provided valuable insights into React's state management and component design.

## Outcome

The Connect 4 project demonstrates proficiency in React, state management, and interactive UI development. It serves as a fun and engaging showcase of frontend skills, and can be extended with features like AI opponents or online multiplayer in the future.
